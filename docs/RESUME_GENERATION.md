# Resume PDF / DOCX generation









































- You can further customize the Blade views (in `resources/views/664259028.blade.php` and `resources/views/resume_en.blade.php`) to include real contact details and additional styling.- If the server does not have `dompdf` installed, the PDF download route falls back to returning HTML as an attachment and includes an `X-Note` header that explains the requirement.## Notes2. Example (simple script idea): create a controller method that uses `\PhpOffice\PhpWord\PhpWord()` to add sections and save as `.docx`, then return as download.```composer require phpoffice/phpword```bash1. Install package:## Generate DOCX with phpoffice/phpword3. The controller will use the `dompdf.wrapper` if available. After installing the package, the PDF download route will return a proper PDF file.```php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Barryvdh\DomPDF\ServiceProvider"```bash2. (optional) Publish config if needed:```composer require barryvdh/laravel-dompdf```bash1. Install package:## Generate PDF with barryvdh/laravel-dompdf- Download PDF: `/resume/{lang}/download/pdf`  (requires optional dependency)- Download Markdown: `/resume/{lang}/download/md`- Download HTML: `/resume/{lang}/download/html`- View: `/resume/{lang?}` — `lang` = `th` (default) or `en`## Available routesThis project includes Blade views and static files for Siwakorn Kleebmek's resume (Thai & English).
